Here's a breakdown of some key areas and recent trends:\n\n**1. AI-Accelerated Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Genomic and Proteomic Analysis:** AI algorithms are becoming incredibly sophisticated at analyzing vast datasets of genomic, proteomic, and other biological information. They can identify novel disease targets (genes, proteins, pathways) that were previously difficult to pinpoint.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** Beyond just identifying targets, AI is helping to predict which of these targets are most likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning that a molecule can be designed to interact with them effectively.\n\n**2. Novel Drug Modalities and Design:**\n\n*   **Beyond Small Molecules:** While small molecule drugs remain important, AI is facilitating the design of entirely new types of therapeutics. This includes:\n    *   **Peptide Therapeutics:** AI can help design custom peptides with specific therapeutic properties.\n    *   **RNA Therapeutics (siRNA, mRNA):** AI is being used to design more stable and effective RNA-based drugs, including those for gene editing or protein replacement.\n    *   **Antibody Engineering:** AI can optimize antibody design for better efficacy, reduced immunogenicity, and improved pharmacokinetic properties.\n*   **Generative AI for Molecule Design:** This is a particularly exciting area. Generative AI models (like those used in image generation) can now be trained to *create* novel molecular structures from scratch, optimizing them for desired properties like binding affinity, solubility, and reduced toxicity. Companies are using this to rapidly explore vast chemical spaces.\n\n**3. Predicting Drug Efficacy and Safety:**\n\n*   **In Silico Pre-clinical Testing:** AI is increasingly used to simulate how a drug might behave in the body *before* extensive lab experiments or clinical trials. This includes predicting:\n    *   **Binding Affinity:** How strongly a drug candidate will bind to its target.\n    *   **ADMET Properties:** Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity. This helps weed out problematic candidates early.\n    *   **Off-Target Effects:** Predicting if a drug might interact with unintended targets, leading to side effects.\n*   **Clinical Trial Optimization:** AI can help identify the most suitable patient populations for clinical trials, predict patient response, and even identify potential adverse events earlier in the trial process.\n\n**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **\"Drug Repurposing\" or \"Drug Repositioning\"** is a well-established strategy, but AI is making it much more efficient. By analyzing vast datasets of drug properties, disease mechanisms, and patient responses, AI can identify existing approved drugs that might be effective against new diseases. This can significantly speed up the development timeline and reduce costs.\n\n**5. Advancements in Specific Disease Areas:**\n\n*   **Oncology:** AI is crucial for identifying new cancer targets, designing personalized cancer therapies (e.g., based on tumor mutations), and predicting patient response to immunotherapy.\n*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** AI is being applied to understand the complex mechanisms of diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and to identify potential drug targets and treatment strategies.\n*   **Infectious Diseases:** AI is being used to discover new antibiotics and antiviral drugs, especially in the face of rising antimicrobial resistance.\n\n**Key Trends and Buzzwords You Might Hear:**\n\n*   **\"De Novo\" Drug Design:** Designing molecules from scratch using AI.\n*   **\"Property Prediction Models\":** AI models trained to predict various drug properties.\n*   **\"Graph Neural Networks\" (GNNs):** A type of AI particularly well-suited for analyzing molecular structures and interactions.\n*   **\"Reinforcement Learning\" for Drug Design:** AI agents learn to design molecules by trial and error, optimizing for desired outcomes.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite these advancements, drug discovery is still a complex and lengthy process. Challenges include:\n\n*   **Translating In Silico Success to In Vivo Reality:** What looks promising in simulations doesn't always work in living organisms.\n*   **Data Quality and Availability:** The effectiveness of AI heavily relies on high-quality, diverse datasets.\n*   **Explainability of AI Models:** Understanding *why* an AI model makes a certain prediction can be difficult, which is crucial for regulatory approval and scientific validation.\n*   **Cost and Accessibility:** Developing and implementing these advanced AI platforms can be expensive.\n\nIn essence, AI is not replacing human scientists in drug discovery, but rather **augmenting and accelerating their efforts**, leading to a more efficient and innovative pipeline for new medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the **\"Novel Drug Modalities and Design\"** aspect of drug discovery, which I mentioned as being heavily influenced by AI. This is a very dynamic and exciting area.\n\nLet me elaborate on what this entails and why it's significant:\n\n**What are \"Novel Drug Modalities\"?**\n\nTraditionally, the vast majority of drugs have been **small molecules** – relatively small chemical compounds that can often be taken orally. While effective for many conditions, small molecules have limitations:\n\n*   **Difficulty reaching certain targets:** Some disease-causing proteins are hard for small molecules to bind to effectively.\n*   **Limited specificity:** Small molecules can sometimes interact with multiple targets, leading to off-target side effects.\n*   **Oral bioavailability challenges:** Some molecules are not well absorbed when taken by mouth.\n\n\"Novel drug modalities\" refers to the development and use of therapeutic agents that go beyond traditional small molecules. These often leverage biological mechanisms or more complex molecular structures.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Novel Drug Modalities:**\n\nAI plays a crucial role in designing, optimizing, and understanding these more complex therapeutics in several ways:\n\n1.  **Designing Complex Biological Molecules:**\n    *   **Peptides:** These are short chains of amino acids. AI can be used to design novel peptide sequences that can act as drugs, for example, by mimicking hormones or blocking protein-protein interactions. AI helps predict how these peptides will fold, bind to targets, and remain stable in the body.\n    *   **Antibodies:** These are large proteins that can be highly specific in targeting disease markers. AI can assist in:\n        *   **Antibody Engineering:** Designing antibodies with enhanced binding affinity, reduced immunogenicity (less likely to cause an immune reaction), and specific functional effects (e.g., activating or blocking a pathway).\n        *   **Bispecific Antibodies:** Designing antibodies that can bind to two different targets simultaneously, which can be useful for bringing immune cells to cancer cells or bridging two signaling molecules.\n    *   **RNA-based Therapeutics (mRNA, siRNA, etc.):** These are revolutionary.\n        *   **mRNA (like in COVID-19 vaccines):** AI can help design more stable and efficient mRNA sequences that deliver genetic instructions to cells to produce therapeutic proteins or antigens.\n        *   **siRNA (small interfering RNA):** These molecules can \"silence\" specific genes that are causing disease. AI is critical for designing siRNA sequences that are highly specific, avoid off-target silencing, and are delivered effectively to target cells.\n\n2.  **Generative AI for Molecular Creation:**\n    *   **Designing New Molecular Structures:** This is a cutting-edge application. Generative AI models can be trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties. They can then be prompted to *create entirely new molecular structures* that are optimized for specific criteria, such as:\n        *   **Target Binding:** Designing a molecule that fits perfectly into the active site of a disease-causing protein.\n        *   **Pharmacokinetic Properties:** Ensuring the molecule can be absorbed, distributed, and eliminated from the body effectively.\n        *   **Reduced Toxicity:** Designing molecules that are less likely to cause harmful side effects.\n    *   **Exploring Chemical Space:** The number of possible drug-like molecules is astronomically large. Generative AI allows researchers to explore this \"chemical space\" much more efficiently, discovering molecules that might never have been conceived through traditional methods.\n\n3.  **Predicting and Optimizing Delivery Mechanisms:**\n    *   **Nanoparticle Design:** Many novel modalities (especially RNA-based drugs) require sophisticated delivery systems, often involving nanoparticles. AI can help design these nanoparticles for optimal size, stability, and targeted delivery to specific tissues or cells.\n\n**Why is this Important?**\n\n*   **Tackling Previously Untreatable Diseases:** Novel drug modalities open up possibilities for treating diseases that are currently difficult or impossible to address with traditional small molecules.\n*   **Increased Precision and Reduced Side Effects:** Many of these newer modalities can be designed to be highly specific to their targets, leading to fewer off-target effects and improved safety profiles.\n*   **Faster Development Cycles (Potentially):** While still complex, AI can accelerate certain stages of design and optimization compared to purely experimental approaches.\n\nThink of it this way: If traditional drug discovery was like building with LEGO bricks (small molecules), AI is now enabling us to design and build with much more complex, specialized, and intelligent building blocks, leading to entirely new structures with enhanced capabilities.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven novel drug modalities is vast and rapidly evolving.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
